	• Maven has multiple life cycle phases:

		- Process-resources (resources:resources)
		- Compile (compiler:compiler)
		- Test (surefire:test)
		- Package (jar:jar)
	
	• Every phase is associated with plugin:goal. When we execute a phase at backend it’s the plugin and goals that are exceuted and performs the task.

	• If we execute test phase, all phases before it will be auto executed.

	• Example: mvn test (this will first run process-resources phase then compile phase and then test phase will be executed. Package phase will not be executed in this case)
